Front-End Developer Coding Challenge:
Create a Movie Search Web App

Objective: Build a movie search web application that allows users to search
for movies and view details about each movie.

Time Limit: Submit assignment by Monday, June 19th 10pm GMT

Instructions:
1. Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the movie search web app.
2. The web app should have a search input field and a search button.
3. When the user enters a movie title in the search input and clicks the
search button, the app should fetch data from an API to retrieve movie
information.
4. Use the OMDb API (http://www.omdbapi.com/) to fetch movie data. You
will need to sign up for an API key, which you can obtain for free on their
website.
5. Display the search results in a visually appealing way. Each movie result
should include the movie title, poster image, release year, and a button
to view more details.
6. When the user clicks the "View Details" button, display additional
information about the movie, such as plot summary, cast, genre, etc.
7. Implement error handling to display a message if the API request fails or
no results are found.
8. Make the web app responsive, ensuring it looks good and functions well
on different screen sizes.
9. Apply appropriate styling, such as typography, colors, and layout, to
create an attractive user interface.

Bonus:
 Implement pagination or infinite scrolling to display multiple pages of
search results.
 Add additional functionality, such as the ability to sort search results by
different criteria (e.g., rating, release date).
 Include movie ratings or reviews from a different API, if available.
